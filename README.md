Stops all processes in the docker container, deletes all images, and deletes all objects.<br>
A script that prepares you to stop the all docker container, delete the image, delete the object and start overã€€'dockre compose' from scratch.<br>
This script doesn't do much at all.<br>
The main usage is as follows.<br><br>

[all processes in the docker container, deletes all images]<br>
xxx$ dockercom remove<br><br>

[Show all running docker processes instead of "docker ps"]<br>
xxx$ dockercom process<br>
...'process' can be 'proc','ps'<br><br>

[Show all running docker container images instead of "docker images"]<br>
xxx$ dockercom images<br><br>

[Show all running docker processes and docker container instead of "docker ps" and "docker images"]<br>
xxx$ dockercom show<br><br>

[Stop all running docker processes instead of "docker stop 08787c23235f cf5a85818448 727a67ae4d69 a30d898a3704"]<br>
xxx$ dockercom stop<br><br>

[Stop all running docker processes,remove all container images,and all docker images]<br>
xxx$ dockercom remove<br><br>

You can also use this script and commands to stop or delete the docker container without using this script.<br>
'dockercom help'<br>
I made it so that you can see it at.<br><br>

'dockercom help'<br>
The displayed contents of are as follows.<br>
